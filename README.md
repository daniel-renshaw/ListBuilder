# ListBuilder

***Warning: This is a personal project and has had some core functionality removed to prevent being misused.***

Unfinished project that was intended to be a cross-platform app that would pull data from github repositories, save that data locally, then use that data as rules to create easily maintainable lists. Lists could be anything from a list of cards for a trading card game to a list of units for a tabletop war game and more.
